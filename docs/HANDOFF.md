# Handoff

Last updated: 2026-10-08 (session 2, Claude Code cloud, branch `claude/trusting-bell-4fgv07`)

## Current state

- Done and verified: **M0**, **M1**, **M1a** (real Supabase), **M2** (`packages/shared_dart`),
  **M3** (ops console, `apps/ops_console`).
- Session 2 started from `9f21c73`. The earlier local M3 attempt was never pushed, so M3 was built
  from scratch here; nothing was duplicated.
- Repository: **https://github.com/iamnawin/anuga** (private). Work is on the branch above with a
  draft PR to `main` (not merged).

## Decisions made

- ADR 0001: build the MVP in parallel with the manual pilot; production launch gated (M10).
- ADR 0002: grants revoked by default; companions use a restricted, time-windowed projection;
  vault reads only through functions that audit in the same transaction; OTP stored as salted hash.
- ADR 0003: PGlite is the default test database; real Supabase (CI job `supabase-local`) is the
  authoritative run.
- M2: `shared_dart` has no Supabase SDK dependency; APIs take an injected `RpcCaller`.
- M3:
  - Ops reads go through ops-only RPCs (migration `0500`) instead of the console joining tables.
    Late threshold (`ops_late_after_minutes`, default 0 = "pickup time passed"), exception lookback
    and maximum board range are `app_settings` rows.
  - `ops_companion_options` lists every companion in the patient's cluster with distance and an
    ineligibility reason; a test proves it agrees with `ops_assign_trip_companion` for every
    companion. The console keeps ineligible companions selectable so the database's own error is shown.
  - Exception actions come from `trip_transitions` (actor `ops`, never `requires_otp`).
  - Console is client-side Next.js with the anon key + user JWT; no service-role key anywhere.
  - Phone OTP on Supabase local: seed `auth.users` rows are now in GoTrue's shape (phone stored
    without `+`, e.g. `919000000001`; `instance_id`, `aud`, non-null token columns and timestamps).
    Test OTP `123456` for the seed numbers only. Supabase Auth refuses phone sign-in without an
    enabled SMS provider, so `config.toml` enables Twilio with fake local placeholders.
  - The ops console uses TypeScript 6 (Next.js needs the TS JS API); root keeps TypeScript 7.
  - `@playwright/test` pinned to 1.56.1 = Chromium build 1194, preinstalled in cloud sessions.
- Repo hosting: `iamnawin/anuga` is canonical. `iamnawin/companion` (old remote) is not updated;
  delete or archive only on founder request.

## Completed work (session 2)

- `supabase/migrations/20261008000500_ops_console.sql`, `supabase/tests/ops_console.test.ts`
  (15 tests: allowed/denied for each RPC, anon denial, settings-driven late flag, options/RPC agreement).
- `supabase/config.toml` (`[auth.sms]`), `supabase/seed/seed.sql` (GoTrue-shaped users),
  `supabase/tests/support/supabase_shim.sql` (matching columns).
- `apps/ops_console`: login (phone OTP, ops-role gate), `/trips`, `/schedules`, `/exceptions`;
  en/te/hi strings; Vitest unit + component tests; Playwright e2e; README.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`apps/*`); root scripts unchanged.
- CI (`.github/workflows/db-tests.yml`): new job `ops-console` (lint, typecheck, test, build);
  `supabase-local` now resets the DB after the SQL tests and runs the Playwright suite, uploading
  screenshots and the report as artifact `ops-console-e2e`.
- Screenshots: `docs/screenshots/m3/`.

## Checks run (2026-10-08, cloud session, Node 24.21.0 via nvm, Docker 29.8.2)

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | pass |
| `pnpm typecheck` (root) | pass |
| `pnpm db:test` (PGlite) | 75 tests: 72 pass, 0 fail, 3 skipped (real-Supabase-only) |
| `supabase db reset` + `pnpm db:test:supabase` (Supabase local in this session, CLI 2.120.0, Postgres 17) | **75/75 pass, 0 skipped** |
| Mutation: removed the ops guard from `ops_exception_queue` | "family and companions are denied" failed as expected; restored |
| Phone OTP via GoTrue REST | ops number + `123456` signs in; wrong code `otp_expired`; unknown number `Signups not allowed` |
| `apps/ops_console`: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build` | pass |
| `apps/ops_console`: `pnpm test` (Vitest) | 36/36 pass |
| `apps/ops_console`: `pnpm e2e` (Playwright vs Supabase local) | **6/6 pass**: non-ops account rejected; ops OTP sign-in + assign backup (persisted after reload); ineligible companion rejected with DB message; schedule primary/backup validation + swap; companion-reported issue appears in exception queue and ops resolves it; Telugu/Hindi switch |
| GitHub Actions on the PR | see the PR checks (recorded below once finished) |

## Checks NOT run yet

- Telugu and Hindi strings have not been reviewed by a native speaker.
- Ops console on a hosted Supabase project: none exists (gated, M10).
- Private storage bucket policies and signed URLs: M8.
- Android toolchain / `flutter doctor`: needed from M4.

## Blockers and risks

- PGlite (Postgres 18) and Supabase (Postgres 17) agree today; `supabase-local` in CI is the authority.
- PGlite does not serialize JS arrays for enum-array parameters; tests pass array literals (`{a,b}`).
- Supabase Auth limits OTP requests per number (~5 s locally); the Playwright suite signs in once
  and reuses the saved session.
- `[auth.sms.test_otp]` and the fake Twilio values are local-only. A hosted project needs a real
  SMS provider (founder authorization; paid service) and must not get test OTPs.

## Exact next task

**M4: companion app** (`docs/TASKS.md` M4): `apps/companion_app` (Flutter, Android first) using
`packages/shared_dart` (`CompanionApi`, `TripStateMachine`): today/upcoming from
`companion_my_trips`, check-in buttons from allowed transitions, OTP entry (`verify_pickup_otp`),
handover note, return legs, complete with post-visit note, issue report; large tap targets;
en/te/hi strings. Acceptance: `flutter analyze` clean; widget tests per trip state; integration
test of the full trip against a fake API client; add a `companion-app` CI job.

## Continue in Claude Code cloud

Setup command for the cloud environment:

```sh
. /opt/nvm/nvm.sh && nvm install 24 && corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm db:test
```

For Supabase local in a cloud session: `nohup dockerd &` (as root), then `docs/SETUP.md` Path B.
