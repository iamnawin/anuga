# AGENTS.md

Instructions for any coding agent (Codex, Gemini, Claude Code, others) working in this repository.
Claude Code also reads `CLAUDE.md`, which has the same rules plus architecture notes.

## Read first

1. `docs/HANDOFF.md`: current state and the exact next task.
2. `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`: shared product requirements, scope limits, data model and access rules.
3. `docs/TASKS.md`: milestones and acceptance criteria.
4. `docs/SETUP.md`: verified tool versions and setup commands.

## Commands

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm db:test       # database tests (PGlite + PostGIS, no Docker)
pnpm typecheck
cd apps/ops_console && pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test   # ops console
```

## Non-negotiables

- Patient permissions are enforced in the database (grants, RLS, restricted functions). Never move
  an access check into app code only.
- Companions never see vault data, diagnoses or date of birth. Vault reads only via audited functions.
- No emergencies, no clinical tasks, no medicine sales (see spec section 1).
- Synthetic data only. No production credentials, paid services or public deploys without founder authorization.
- Every access rule has allowed and denied tests. Update `docs/TASKS.md` and `docs/HANDOFF.md` after each milestone.
- Package managers: pnpm for Node, uv for Python.
